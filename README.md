A repository of code used for calculating the scores of Kvizdarije quizzing competition. Within the course of a year (2019-2020), a total of 10 quizzes were held, each containing 120 questions divided into 8 categories, each having 15 questions. The best 8 of the total of 10 rounds are considered for every player. The best player in each category gains a hundred points, the others get a score equal to the percentage of the best player's score. A separate table is kept for each category and for the total result. In the end, the best three players in each category were awarded at the annual Mirko Miočić Memorial, taking place in Zadar.
